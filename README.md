# Fawkes

This is a test app to try to replicate the structure found in [decidim/decidim][decidim] in Phoenix.

Goals:

- [x] The blog layout should extend the base one
- [ ] The blog code should live outside the app

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
